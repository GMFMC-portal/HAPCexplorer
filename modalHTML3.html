            <p>We understand that spatial data can be pretty complicated and often requires use of expensive software. We hope this application 
                allows you to easily explore what the Council is up to with corals in the Gulf.
            </p>

        <p>The locations of current HAPCs and those recommended in <a href="http://gulfcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/Coral-9-PHD-10102017.pdf" target="_blank">Coral Amendment 9</a> are provided here 
        for visualization, as are coral observations.</p>
            <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #000;">
		
		<h3 style="color: black;">So what are HAPCs and why do they exist?</h3><br>
		
		<p>A HAPC is a subset of Essential Fish Habitat (EFH), which provides an extremely 
            important ecological function or are especially vulnerable to degradation.  If you want to learn more about EFH, 
            check out our some of our other web applications, click <a href ="http://portal.gulfcouncil.org/EFHreview.html">here</a> for 
            information about our EFH 5-Year Review or <a href="http://portal.gulfcouncil.org/EFHMap.html">here</a> for spatial representations 
            of our current EFH designations.  
            
        <p>The purpose of HAPCs is to focus conservation, management, and research efforts on these 
            important areas, and does not necessarily apply additional protections or restrictions to a designated area.  In 
            some instances the Councils and NMFS may develop fishery management measures to conserve the habitat within the HAPC.  
            HAPC designation may be warranted for areas that play a vital role in the reproductive cycle of a managed species (e.g., 
            grouper spawning sites) or areas that contain a rare habitat type (e.g., corals) that may be sensitive to disturbance from 
            fishing or other human activities.</p> 
            
        <p>Councils may designate an area as a HAPC for one or more of the following reasons: (1) 
            the habitat provides important ecological functions; (2) the habitat is sensitive to human-induced environmental degradation; 
            (3) development activities are, or will be, stressing the habitat; (4) the habitat type is rare.</p>
        
        <hr style="border-top: 1px solid #000;">
        
		<h3 style="color: black;">What can you do with this application?</h3><br>
		
		<p>The first tab (‘Map’) includes several layers:<br><br>
             (1) designated HAPCs with one of more HAPC specific fishing regulations; <br>
             (2) designated HAPCs without specific HAPC fishing regulations;<br>
             (3) areas that have been recommended for HAPC designation;<br>
             (4) coral locations;<br>
             (5) a nautical chart <br><br> 
             
             In total, there are five layers that can be turned on or off using the check box in the bottom left corner. 
             The various HAPC types are discernible by color, and identified in the legend in the bottom right of the viewer. 
             For the coral locations layer, each coral observation can be clicked to see the type of coral and the depth it was observed.</p><br>
		
		<p>Each of the remaining tabs provides information on the current and recommended HAPCs and coral locations.  
            Recommendations for HAPC designation were based largely on area-specific knowledge of habitats and research 
            identifying and describing corals and coral reefs by the scientific community. For reference, we have included an 
            aggregated database of known locations supporting deep or shallow water corals. We do not pretend to have documentation of 
            every coral in the Gulf but we have tried to represent the information as best we know it. We do plan to update this as new 
            information becomes available and if you know of something we missed please 
            <a href = "mailto: portal@gulfcouncil.org">contact us</a> so we can update our database.</p><br>
